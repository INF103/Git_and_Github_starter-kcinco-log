Honestly there is definitely a lot of information to take in all at once. So far, I've learned how to do pull requests, create this markdown file, and merge branches. There are more actions I know I can perform,
but it is still difficult to remember for me. I will just have to use Github more and adjust to its features as I continue its uses.
